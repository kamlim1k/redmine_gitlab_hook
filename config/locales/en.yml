  prune:
    label: Prune
    description: 'After fetching, prune removes any remote-tracking references that no longer exist on the remote. Tags are not subject to pruning if they are fetched only because of the default tag auto-following or due to a --tags option. However, if tags are fetched due to an explicit refspec (either on the command line or in the remote configuration, for example if the remote was cloned with the --mirror option), then they are also subject to pruning.'
  fetch_updates:
      label: Fetch updates from repository
      description: 'This option fetches updates from remote repository. Set it to No if repository shared - for example gitlab and redmine on the same machine.'
